                     In my earlier letter, I promised not to give you a mid-life crisis, but I can't resist cracking a few jokes. Remember, forty is the old age of youth; fifty is the youth of old age.
                    <br>
                    It's been quite a ride, hasn't it? From being my superhero dad to becoming my go-to buddy and secret-keeper, you've been everything I could ever ask for. These 20 years have been epic, with you being my rock, my guide, and my biggest cheerleader.
                    <br>
                    I cherish all our crazy chats, our wild adventures, and every single laugh we've shared. You've always taught me to be true to myself, to work hard, and to be a jack of all trades. That advice about grades not defining me but rather being a well-rounded person does â€“ that's pure gold, Dad.
                    <br>
                    On your special day, I just want to say I love you heaps! Here's to more fun, more lessons, and more memories. Happy Birthday, Pops!
                    <br>
                    Lots of love,
                    Your favorite daughter  </p>
